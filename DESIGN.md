# Goals

* Keep this super simple.  it should work with just bare python
  so that the users can use it without having to create a venv and
  install bunch of packages.

* We could provide a interface to the latex to xml compiler via the
  cli.  this would allow the users to try things out without having to
  install the compiler.
